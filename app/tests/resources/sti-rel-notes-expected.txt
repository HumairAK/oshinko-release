# Oshinko S2I images used by these templates
These templates use the following oshinko s2i images:

- radanalyticsio/radanalytics-pyspark:v0.5.2 found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/radanalyticsio/radanalytics-pyspark/)
- radanalyticsio/radanalytics-java-spark:v0.5.2 found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/radanalyticsio/radanalytics-java-spark/)
- radanalyticsio/radanalytics-scala-spark:v0.5.2 found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/radanalyticsio/radanalytics-scala-spark/)

# Apache Spark version
The referenced oshinko s2i images use Apache Spark 2.3.0

# Oshinko binary version
The referenced oshinko s2i images use oshinko binary release v0.5.2 found [here](https://github.com/radanalyticsio/oshinko-cli/releases/tag/v0.5.2)

# Summary of changes in templates
The S2I templates now support kubernetes native scheduling for spark applications as an option
instead of a Spark standalone deployment. To use this deployment mode, set the
OSHINKO_KUBE_SCHEDULER parameter to true when launching the template. Note that
clusters created this way are always ephemeral and do not support some oshinko options
like cluster configuration configmaps.
